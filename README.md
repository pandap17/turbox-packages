# Creating a Turbox Package for Your Application

Turbox is a platform that allows users to build and share applications using a simple package format. This document provides instructions on how to create a Turbox Package for your application.

## Step 1: Download the AppBuilder.py File

- Go to the [AppBuilder.py file](https://github.com/pandap17/turbox-packages/tree/main/appbuilder) in the Turbox Packages GitHub repository.
- Download the `AppBuilder.py` file to your local machine.

## Step 2: Run the AppBuilder.py File

- Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
- Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `AppBuilder.py` file.
- Run the file using the appropriate command for your operating system (e.g., `python AppBuilder.py`).
- After running the file, a dialog window will appear.

## Step 3: Select Your Sprite Files

- In the dialog window, you will be prompted to select files.
- Choose all the sprite3 files that are part of your application.
- Make sure to select all the relevant files to ensure your application works correctly.

## Step 4: Include Extensions (if applicable)

- After selecting the sprite files, another dialog window will appear.
- This dialog will ask if your application uses any extensions.
- If your application relies on any JavaScript (JS) extensions, you need to provide their links.
- Copy and paste all the links to the JS extensions your application uses into the dialog.
- This step is crucial for ensuring the proper functionality of your application.

## Step 5: Provide a Name for Your Application

- Once you have provided the necessary files and extensions, you will be asked to name your application.
- Give your application a meaningful and descriptive name.
- Enter the desired name in the dialog window.

## Step 6: Build Your Application

- After specifying the application name, the script will start building your app.
- The resulting file will be saved in the same directory where you ran the `AppBuilder.py` file.
- Wait for the script to complete the build process.

## Step 7: Add the Package to the Turbox Packages Repository

- Fork the [turbox-packages](https://github.com/pandap17/turbox-packages) repository on GitHub.
- Ensure that your forked repository is up to date with the latest changes from the main repository.
- Add your Turbox Package file to the main directory of your forked repository.
- Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.

## Step 8: Submit a Pull Request

- Once you have added your package to the main directory of your forked repository, submit a pull request.
- Provide a clear and concise description of your package in the pull request.
- Wait for the maintainers of the `turbox-packages` repository to review your pull request.

By following these steps, you can create a Turbox Package for your application and contribute it to the Turbox Packages repository, allowing others to discover and use your application easily.
